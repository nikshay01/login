Game Name: lANGfLIP 1 TO 11



Overview:

	Yeh ek fun aur fast game hai jisme aapko 1 se 11 tak ginti bolni hai — Hindi aur English mix karke.

	Rule simple hai: jo number pehle player ne jis language mein bola, next player ko uska **opposite language** use karna hai.

	Jaise:
	Player 1: One → Player 2: Do → Player 3: Three... aur aise hi 11 tak.
	Jaise hi koi "11" bolta hai, next player firse "1" se start karega, lekin language flip karni padegi.
	Galti ki toh out! Last bacha winner! 













COMPLETE VERSION:
How to Play:

1. Start:
   - Choose a starting player.
   - That player says "1" in either English (One) or Hindi (Ek).

2. Taking Turns:
   - Each next player continues counting up to 11, one number per turn.
   - You must say your number in the other language than the one used before you.

3. Reset Rule:
   - After "11", the next player resets the count to "1", but continues the language-switching rule.


extra rules:
	 	- one of the player will recive a joker card and he can switch to whatever number or language for once only.(i think half of players should have joker card it'd make it more intresting)
		- every round there will be some "chaos" numbers and for example 5 and 1 are chaos number then the person to say five in whichever languge will have to shout OOOOHHHH!! before saying the number and for 1 they they will have to perform a short dance move or clap or jump etc(to be discussed)
		- rapid fire: time limit gets down to 1-2 second

   Player 1: One (English)
